- Morays is a project that illustrates how to deploy ML-based components in ocean models with Eophis.

- It also serves as a platform for collaborative collections of ocean-models experiments conducted within this framework.

Strategy
--------

`Eophis`_ is a python package built on `OASIS`_ that facilitates the deployment of inference models (i.e. models based on machine learning components) for coupled runs with Earth-System simulation codes. The last OASIS version allows communication between non-homogeneously written codes. This tool is particularly suitable for our purposes since an OASIS interface already exists in several ocean models.





Ocean models taken into consideration in the Morays project are:
    - `NEMO`_
    - `CROCO`_ (not started yet)
