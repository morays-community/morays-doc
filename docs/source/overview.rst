`Morays`_ is a GitHub organization that provides a collection of deployment examples of the `Eophis`_ package in ocean models. It also proposes a solution for sharing the model experiments across centers. Our ambition is to offer a platform for fostering exchanges amongst Eophis users.

-------------------------------

`OASIS`_ is a parallelized Fortran coupling library that performs field exchanges between coupled executables. Eophis is a Python library that facilitates the creation and the configuration of an OASIS environment in a Python script to couple with Fortran/C geoscientific codes. It can be deployed with any geoscientific model if it does possess an OASIS interface.

In this context, a Morays experiment is an ocean simulation in which the physical model sends fields towards an external Python script deployed by Eophis. The results computed by the Python model are sent back to the ocean and retroactively used for the solution.

Typical applications include:
    - Hybrid Machine Learning (ML) / Physics modeling
    - Deployment of fast evolving high-level libraries in stable low-level codes
    - Prototypal code testing

-------------------------------

Main purpose of this organization is to store examples of Morays experiments for different ocean models. So far, codes taken into consideration in this project are:

..

    - `NEMO`_
    - `CROCO`_ *(not started yet)*

-------------------------------

Every Morays experiments are documented in a self contained separate GitHub repository, that provides all the material for reproducing the use case. List of available experiments can be found in this `section <https://morays-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/morays_exp.html>`_. A last objective of this documentation is to give detailed guidelines to create custom Morays test cases.
