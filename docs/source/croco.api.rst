CROCO for Morays
================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Let's recall that a Morays experiment is an ocean simulation that exchanges fields with an external Python script through OASIS. The strategy is to deploy the OASIS interface in the Python side and configure the global coupling environment with help of the Eophis library.

From this point, we consider that all the Python material is already well configured. See `Eophis documentation <https://eophis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or this `upcoming tutorial` for more details. What remains now is to configure the OASIS interface of CROCO in accordance with Eophis. This is described in this section.
